The repo contains my solutions to the weekly project assignments for the "Algorithms, Part I" course by Princeton (Coursera).

The course follows the Princeton COS226 closely:
"This course surveys the most important algorithms and data structures in use on computers today. Particular emphasis is given to algorithms for sorting, searching, and string processing. Fundamental algorithms in a number of other areas are covered as well, including geometric and graph algorithms. The course will concentrate on developing implementations, understanding their performance characteristics, and estimating their potential effectiveness in applications."

The project descriptions are:

1) Week3Project - Pattern Recognition

The problem. Write a program to recognize line patterns in a given set of points.
Computer vision involves analyzing patterns in visual images and reconstructing the real-world objects that produced them. The process in often broken up into two phases: feature detection and pattern recognition. Feature detection involves selecting important features of the image; pattern recognition involves discovering patterns in the features. We will investigate a particularly clean pattern recognition problem involving points and line segments. This kind of pattern recognition arises in many other applications such as statistical data analysis.

2) Week4Project - 8 Puzzle
Write a program to solve the 8-puzzle problem (and its natural generalizations) using the A* search algorithm.

The problem. The 8-puzzle problem is a puzzle invented and popularized by Noyes Palmer Chapman in the 1870s. It is played on a 3-by-3 grid with 8 square tiles labeled 1 through 8 and a blank square. Your goal is to rearrange the tiles so that they are in order, using as few moves as possible. You are permitted to slide tiles horizontally or vertically into the blank square. The following shows a sequence of legal moves from an initial board (left) to the goal board (right).

3) Week5Project - Kd-trees
Create a symbol table data type whose keys are two-dimensional points. 

The problem. Use a 2d-tree to support efficient range search (find all of the points contained in a query rectangle) and nearest neighbor search (find a closest point to a query point). 2d-trees have numerous applications, ranging from classifying astronomical objects to computer animation to speeding up neural networks to mining data to image retrieval.
